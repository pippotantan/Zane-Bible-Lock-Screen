# DailyFaith

DailyFaith turns your lock screen and home screen into a daily dose of Scripture. It pairs a random Bible verse with a beautiful background image, then generates a wallpaper you can set manually or have updated automatically on a schedule.

## Features

### Verse Wallpapers
- **Daily verse wallpapers** — Random verse over a high-quality background, with readable text and dark overlay for contrast.
- **Verse by topic** — Filter verses by keyword: All (66 books), Love, Strength, Hope, Peace, Faith, Comfort, Wisdom, Grace, or Joy.
- **Offline verses** — 100+ verses are stored locally so the app can show random verses even without an internet connection.

### Background Images
- **Unsplash (online)** — High-quality images from Unsplash API. Filter by keyword: All, Nature, Christian, Animals, Wildlife, Outer Space, Landscape, Sky, Ocean, Mountains, or Flowers.
- **Device gallery (offline)** — Select multiple images from your gallery. The app picks one randomly for each background. Works fully offline.
- **Background source** — Choose Unsplash or your gallery in Wallpaper Settings. When offline, Unsplash automatically falls back to local gallery if available.
- **Unsplash attribution** — Photographer credit shown at the bottom when using Unsplash images.

### Customization
- **Font size, alignment, color** — Adjust how the verse appears on the wallpaper.
- **Font family** — Roboto, Playfair Display, or Great Vibes.
- **Use for daily** — Apply your editor settings to scheduled wallpapers.
- **Apply where** — Lock screen only, home screen only, or both (via Wallpaper Settings).

### Wallpaper Updates
- **Manual** — Set the current verse + image as your wallpaper with one tap.
- **Scheduled** — Daily refresh at a time you choose (e.g. each morning). Uses WorkManager for reliable background execution.
- **Capture preview** — Save the current design as an image without setting it as wallpaper.

### Offline Support
- **Works offline** — With local gallery images selected, the app can update wallpapers without internet. Offline verses are pre-loaded for all topics.
- **Scheduled updates offline** — Daily wallpaper tasks run even when the device is offline, using local images and verses.
